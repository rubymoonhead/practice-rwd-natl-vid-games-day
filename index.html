						<h2>Will the real National Video Games Day please stand up</h2>
						<p>
							Playing video games is one of my favorite activities.<br>
							This is the reason I chose this special September holiday theme for this coding lab activity.
						</p>
						<p>
							NVGD is celebrated yearly and only in this country.
						</p>
						<p>
							There is also a "National Video <em>Game</em> Day" that's celebrated on 8 July; however, this site is dedicated to the real NVGD and that is September's <strong><span class="emphasize">National Video <em>Games</em> Day</strong></span>.
						</p>
						<p>
							According to <a href="https://www.calendarr.com/united-states/national-video-game-day/" target="_blank">Calendarr</a>, in 1997, the celebrated holiday's date moved from 8 July to 12 September, and the event was then named "National Video <em>Games</em> Day".
						</p>
						<p>
							The <a href="https://gamehistory.org/why-is-today-national-video-game-day/" target="_blank">Video Game History Foundation</a> says that the first day NVGD was celebrated was on 8 July 1991, then the NVGD date moved to 12 September 1997.<br>
							The author goes on to say that a certain David Earle, President of Kid Vid Warriors, had sponsored the event every year from 8 July 1991 to 8 July 1993, then on 12 July 1994 and 12 July 1995, and finally on 10 September 1996.<br>
							The article shows printed proof (a 1997 edition of <em>Chase's Calendar of Events</em>) that 12 September <strong>is</strong> the official date for National Video Games Day.
						</p>
						<p>
							<a href="https://www.thegamer.com/national-video-game-day-pointless-holiday/" target="_blank">TheGamer</a> says that the 8 July National Video <em>Game</em> Day holiday is a "pointless holiday".<br>
							TheGamer believes that the only one true video games holiday is on 12 September and is National Video <em>Games</em> Day.<br>
							The 8 July holiday was, according to the author, "a made up holiday created by the fake president of a pretend club in a phoney book".<br>
							I laughed after reading that line.
						</p>
						<p>
							I, too, believe that the only real celebrated National Video <em>Games</em> Day is on 12 September.<br>
							"National Video <em>Games</em> Day" looks and sounds a lot better than "National Video <em>Game</em> Day".<br>
							Besides, the "games" version gives me a good feeling that this holiday celebration includes every video game and every type of video game player.

						<h2>Celebrate NVGD your way!</h2>
						<p>
							Are you a video game fanatic (like me 😁)? Good for you! Or are you an occasional video game player? Also good for you!
						</p>
						<p>
							This day offers an opportunity to celebrate this special national holiday your way.
						</p>
						<p>
							You might play a level that's been bugging you for weeks, or re-start a game from the very beginning, if you've forgotten where you ended last.<br>Or you might start a game you've downloaded weeks ago and haven't played yet.
						</p>
						<p>
							Do whatever you want!
						</p>
						<p>
							If you're the kind of person who likes to play in a dark room, close the blinds, keep the room lights off, put your headphones on, set your iphone or android on do not disturb mode, and play video games all day.
						</p>
						<p>
							If you don't like playing alone, invite friends over.<br>Make it a video games party, or do the online multiplayer thing.
						</p>
						<p>
							Today, video game players rule!
						</p>
						<p>
							Now that you know all about the <span class="emphasize">official 12 September National Video Games Day</span>, treat yourself today!
						</p>
						<p>
							Buy any or all of the games mentioned here or a newly released game.
						</p>
						<p>

						<h2>The 3 top video games to date (from 3 popular genres of 2021) that you <strong>must</strong> play</h2>
						<p>
							To polish off this special holiday, I'd like to recommend exceptional games from each of this year's three popular genres: Action RPG, Real-time Strategy, and Fighting & Martial Arts.<br>
							I've played the first 2 games, but I haven't played the third game yet.<br>
						</p>

							This is my best-loved genre.
						</p>

						<h4>Grim Dawn</h4>
						<p>
							<span class="bold"><strong>Summary: </strong></span>"Players are thrust into the dark, war-torn world of Cairn where a once proud empire has been brought to ruin and the human race driven to the edge of extinction. Cairn has become ground zero of an eternal war between two otherworldly powers, one seeking to use human bodies as a resource, the other intent upon destroying the human race before that can happen. This cataclysmic war has not only decimated human civilization but is warping the very fabric of reality and, in its wake, giving life to new horrors." <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/grim-dawn" target="_blank">Metacritic</a><br>
